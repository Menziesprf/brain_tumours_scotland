# Brain Tumours in Scotland project

This was the final project I completed as part of Codeclan's data analysis course.

The aim was to provide some insight into the incidence of brain tumours in Scotland in recent years. 

To see the findings I presented please pull this repository and open the powerpoint presentation located in the "presentation" folder.
