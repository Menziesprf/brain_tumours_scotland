"1)  Based on the most recent 2019 Health Board areas.  

The 2019 areas differ from the previous areas due to a boundary change at Cardowan by Stepps, between Greate Glasgow and Clyde and Lanarkshire health board areas. The boundary change resulted in approximately 400 people transferring from Greater Glasgow and Clyde to Lanarkshire. These moves have been  accounted for as migration within Scotland.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
